<li>The dice are displayed on the screen and if it is number 1 the player loses his current turn/current score and the another player can roll the dice. If it is not the number 1, the dice value is added to the current score;</li>
<li>The current player can click the "HOLD" button to add their current score to their general score and pass their turn;</li>
<li>The player who scores 100 points first wins the game.</li>
